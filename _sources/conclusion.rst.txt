Conclusion
==========

A reliable statistical model wasn't found.


Next Steps
----------

Two main areas of work were not explored further due to time and computing constraints:

**Data Engineering**

GFS
  The GFS data used was at a 1Â° spatial resolution.  A higher granularity of data would more accurately drive 


**Feature Engineering**

Population Weights

Additional data engineering work could benefit the predictive capabilities of the approaches laid out in this study.  Of note, historic weather forecasts at a higher resolution
