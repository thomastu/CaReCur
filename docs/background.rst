Motivation
==========

This is part of an independent study to apply statistical approaches to describing renewable curtailment events.  
Primarily, we are motivated by the following questions:

- What are explanatory or predictive variables that can predict economic solar curtailment in the California grid?
- What are the policies and mechanisms that are used to deploy economic curtailment?
- Given a day ahead weather forecast, can we predict the net load (total load - renewable intermittent generation)?
  - With a week ahead forecast?
-  Can we calculate or measure the economic value from existing curtailment practices?

Background
----------

As intermittent sources of generation continue to grow, overcapacity may result in events where generation may exceed available demand.  Balancing authorities must decide how to ramp down total generation to keep the grid in balance.  Renewables (specifically solar PV) are typically the most economically efficient source to curtail :cite:`Bird2014`.
