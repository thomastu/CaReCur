    abstract = {Curtailment is a reduction in the output of a generator from what it could otherwise produce given available resources, typically on an involuntary basis. Curtailment of generation has been a normal occurrence since the beginning of the electric power industry. However, owners of wind and solar generation, which have no fuel costs, are concerned about the impacts of curtailment on project economics. Operator-induced curtailment typically occurs because of transmission congestion or lack of transmission access, but it can occur for a variety of other reasons, such as excess generation during low load periods, voltage, or interconnection issues. Market-based protocols that dispatch generation based on economics can also result in wind and solar energy plants generating less than what they could potentially produce. This report examines U.S. curtailment practices regarding wind and solar generation, with a particular emphasis on utilities in the western states. The information presented here is based on a series of interviews conducted with utilities, system operators, wind energy developers, and other stakeholders. The report provides case studies of curtailment experience and examines the reasons for curtailment, procedures, compensation, and practices that can minimize curtailment. Key findings include: • In the largest markets for wind power, the amount of curtailment appears to be declining even as the amount of wind power on the system increases. Curtailment levels have generally been 4{\%} or less of wind generation in regions where curtailment has occurred. Many utilities in the western states report negligible levels of curtailment. The most common reasons for curtailment are insufficient transmission and local congestion and excessive supply during low load periods. • Definitions of curtailment and data availability vary. Understanding curtailment levels can be complicated by relatively new market-based protocols or programs that dispatch wind down or limit wind generation to schedules and the lack of uniformity in data collection. • Compensation and contract terms are changing as curtailment becomes of greater concern to solar and wind plant owners. Increasingly there are negotiated contract provisions addressing use of curtailment hours and there is greater explicit sharing of risk between the generator and off-taker. • Automation can reduce curtailment levels. Manual curtailment processes can extend curtailment periods because of the time needed for implementation and hesitancy to release units from curtailment orders. • Market solutions that base dispatch levels on economics offer the advantages of creating transparency and automation in curtailment procedures, which apply equally to all generators. • Curtailed wind and solar resources may provide ancillary services to aid in system operations. • A variety of solutions is being used to reduce curtailments: transmission expansion and interconnection upgrades; operational changes such as forecasting and increased automation of signaling; and better management of reserves and generation.},

abstract = {During times of oversupply, the bulk energy market first competitively selects the lowest cost power resources. Renewable resources can " bid " into the market in a way to reduce production when prices begin to fall. This is a normal and healthy market outcome. Then, self-scheduled cuts are triggered and prioritized using operational and tariff considerations. Economic curtailments and self-scheduled cuts are considered " market-based, " because the ISO's market optimization software automatically adjusts supply with demand. Finally, if market-based solutions haven't cleared the surplus of electricity that could be generated, the last resort is for the ISO to manually intervene, which is called an " exceptional dispatch. " In this scenario, ISO grid operators call on specific renewable plants to reduce output to prevent or relieve conditions that risk grid reliability. The exceptional dispatch order is considered a " manual " curtailment, because the ISO operators must manually intervene. This is not preferred, because it does not ensure the lowest cost resources are called upon to serve Californians, and in many cases, it reduces the output of renewable plants.},
